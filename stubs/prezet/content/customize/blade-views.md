When you installed the Prezet package, the blade components were published to your application's `resources/views/vendor/prezet/components` directory. To tailor the components to your specific requirements, you can modify these files directly. The blade components are organized within this directory as follows:

```plaintext
resources/
└── views/
    └── vendor/
        └── prezet/
            ├── index.blade.php
            ├── ogimage.blade.php
            ├── show.blade.php
            └── components/
                ├── layout.blade.php
                ├── meta.blade.php
                └── youtube.blade.php
```

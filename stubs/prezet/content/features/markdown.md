This blog is generated entirely from markdown files. When you ran the `prezet::install` command markdown files were loaded into your laravel application's `./storage/prezet/` directory. Here is the structure of those files:

```bash
storage/
└── prezet/
    ├── .obsidian/
    │   └── ...
    ├── content/
    │   ├── installation.md
    │   ├── configuration.md
    │   ├── features/
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── customize/
    │       └── ...
    ├── images/
    │   ├── markdown-20240509210223449.webp
    │   └── ogimages/
    │       └── ...
    └── SUMMARY.md
```

The `./storage/prezet/content/` directory contains the actual markdown files that are converted into html when the blog is loaded.

The `./storage/prezet/images/` directory stores the images that are referenced in the markdown files. When a markdown file references an image, the `MarkdownImageExtension` automatically links those images to a packaged controller that serves the images in the most efficient format and size based on the user's device. You can find more information about how Prezet automatically optimizes images [here](images)

Inside the images directory, there is a folder called `ogimages` that contains any open graph images used by the blog posts. You can learn more about using Prezet to generate open graph images [here](ogimage).

The `SUMMARY.md` file is used to generate the structure on the left side of the page. This gives you control over the order and categories in which each post appears.

## Table of Contents

If you're on desktop, you should see a table of contents on the right side of the page. This is automatically generated based on the headings in the markdown file.

## Blade Components
Much like MDX where you can include JSX components in a markdown file, Prezet lets you include blade components in your markdown files. You can read more about using blade components in markdown [here](blade).

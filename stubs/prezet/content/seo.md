Prezet automatically generates meta tags for your pages based on the front matter of your markdown files. This includes the title, description, and open graph image.

## SEO Metadata Preview

Below you can see a blade component that previews the title, description, and og:image tags of the current page.

```html +parse
<x-prezet::meta></x-prezet::meta>
```

## Open Graph Images

An Open Graph (OG) image is a visual representation of a webpage that appears when the page is shared on social media platforms or messaging apps to help enhance the visibility and engagement of shared links. It is specified using the "og:image" meta tag in the HTML head section of the webpage.
